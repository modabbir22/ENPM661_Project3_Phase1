To run this file do the following: 
1) Press Run or type .py in the terminal 
2) Inputs given: \
Clearance - 5 \
Radius - 2 \
Robot Step size - 2 \
X- coordinate of start node - 10 \
Y - coordinate of start node - 10 \
Orientation of the robot at initial point - 30 \
X- coordinate of goal node - 1150 \
Y - coordinate of goal node - 30 \
Orientation of the robot at final point - 30 \

Output: There will be 2 plots and videos generated once you the run the code. 
First plot will be visualization of node exploration which will generate a plot of visualization and saved mp4 file named 'node_exploration_animation.mp4' .
Once the node exploration visualization is completed, you will have to close the plot in order to visualize the path exploration which will generate another plot and saved mp4 file named 'optimal_path_animation.mp4'.

Note: Don't forget to the plot of node exploration visualization so that the path exploration visualization pops up.
